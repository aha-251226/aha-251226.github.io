However, despite this demand, there is a lack of guidance on the scale and methods for procuring initial investment for proactive maintenance. In light of this, this study analyzes the government budget scale and the scale of external funding for proactive maintenance of road infrastructure. The results of a 30-year scenario analysis of proactive maintenance investment reveal that external funding for proactive maintenance can be secured up to a maximum of 15%.</p> </body></html>
