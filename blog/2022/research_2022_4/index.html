The analysis revealed that in the domestic context, the focus was primarily on road facilities, while overseas, studies were conducted on integrated infrastructure maintenance priority determination models. Research pertaining to priority determination for infrastructure maintenance from an integrated perspective included studies on predicting maintenance timing and costs based on the age of the infrastructure, as well as optimizing budget allocation within constrained budgets. These studies exhibited a mixed-method approach to accommodate various variables.</p> </body></html>
